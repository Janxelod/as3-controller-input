AS3 Controller Input
====================

AS3 Controller Input is a library used for abstracting away all the game input logic within Adobe AIR, allowing you to have a simple interface to use Ouya and Xbox360 controllers within your flash game.

Warning
-------

Work in progress. Use at your own risk.

What Does It Do?
----------------

It allows you to easily get interfaces to interact with any number of connected ouya or xbox controllers. Once you grab a connected controller, you can test:

* Button presses
* Button holding
* Joystick angle
* Joystick distance
* Joystick axis values
* Trigger values

How To Use
----------

1. Add GameInputControlName to your project (typically by adding the SWC to your build path). You can find it in the [Adobe Gaming SDK](http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/gamingsdk/).
2. Add AS3 Controller Input to your project (copy the source files over, or add the external folder to your build path).
3. ... (TODO)
4. Profit!
